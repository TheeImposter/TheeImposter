# MidnightLabs: Documenting the EXP Grind

MidnightLabs is a living lab journal—a place to track, quantify, and reflect on the process of becoming a cybersecurity investigator and infrastructure specialist.

I’m a U.S. military veteran, currently studying networking and cybersecurity through both formal coursework and independent labs. My learning style is hands-on and game-oriented—I treat every configuration, failure, and rebuild like part of a larger campaign. This repository isn’t a highlight reel—it’s a trail of real progress, built in the midnight hours, one milestone at a time.

Right now, my focus is on expanding a virtual enterprise environment: multi-branch Active Directory, hybrid infrastructure, and simulated corporate networks. The goal is to fully diagram and document this system, then evolve it into a red team/blue team playground for active investigation and defense practice.

Each folder in this repo reflects a phase of that process. You’ll find raw lab notes, rebuild reflections, study journals, and technical configs—sometimes clean, sometimes messy, always real. Over time, this space will grow to include custom tools, digital forensics notes, and full threat walkthroughs based on simulated incidents.

This isn’t just about learning. It’s about building something I can point to—an archive of skill and growth that evolves as I do.
