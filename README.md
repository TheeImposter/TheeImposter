## MidnightLabs: Where Theory Meets Fire

This isn't a portfolio.  
This is a journal of digital warfare, built in public.

While studying cybersecurity, I’m building and breaking real infrastructure. MidnightLabs started as a test lab — now it mirrors the structure of a real company, complete with Active Directory domains, simulated users, GPOs, file servers, and threat drills.

If it breaks, I fix it.  
If it works, I scale it.  
If it’s unclear, I document it.
