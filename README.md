# MidnightLabs: A Cybersecurity Learning Journey

MidnightLabs is my personal lab journal and portfolio—a space where I document the real process of learning cybersecurity from the ground up. This isn’t just about theory. It’s about putting hands on systems, breaking things, rebuilding them, and tracking every lesson along the way.

Right now, I’m focused on mastering infrastructure and networking fundamentals. That includes Active Directory labs, Cisco’s Introduction to Networks (via Netacad), and plenty of rebuild cycles to deepen my understanding. I’m approaching this like an EXP grind—where each lab and note is a milestone toward long-term mastery.

This repo contains detailed notes, project folders, and reflections from every stage of the journey. Each entry is meant to capture more than just what I did—it’s about how I learned, what I noticed, and how I plan to improve. Over time, these notes will evolve into deeper simulations, including red team and blue team scenarios that reflect real-world cybersecurity challenges.

Eventually, I’ll expand this into tools, investigations, and writeups—bridging the gap between study and real-world application. I also believe in balancing life with tech, so you might see the occasional system log or side project that reflects that rhythm.

This project was built in the midnight hour, with intention and grit. Thanks for stopping by.
